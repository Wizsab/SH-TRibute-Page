            <h2> <u>Early Life</u> </h2>
            <p>Lincoln was born in a backwoods cabin 3 miles (5 km) south of <b>Hodgenville, Kentucky,</b> and was taken to a farm in the neighbouring valley of Knob Creek when he was two years old. His earliest memories were of this home and, in particular,
                of a flash flood that once washed away the corn and pumpkin seeds he had helped his father plant. His father, Thomas Lincoln, was the descendant of a weaver’s apprentice who had migrated from England to Massachusetts in 1637. Though much
                less prosperous than some of his Lincoln forebears, Thomas was a sturdy pioneer. On June 12, 1806, he married Nancy Hanks. The Hanks genealogy is difficult to trace, but Nancy appears to have been of illegitimate birth. She has been described
                as “stoop-shouldered, thin-breasted, sad,” and fervently religious. Thomas and Nancy Lincoln had three children: Sarah, Abraham, and Thomas, who died in infancy.</p>

        <h3> <u>Timeline of Abraham's Life</u> </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1842</li>
            <p>
                In 1842, Lincoln married Mary Todd, and their relationship, as well as the part she played in his subsequent career, remain a matter of some debate. The pair met in 1839 and were engaged in December 1840 but they called off a wedding scheduled for 1 January
                1841 at Lincoln's initiative. However, after meeting again they finally married on 8 November 1842.
            </p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>1844</li>
            <p>
                In 1844, they bought a house in Springfield near Lincoln's law firm and she took care of the house diligently on a limited budget. They had four sons including Robert Todd Lincoln, who was born in 1843 and was their only child to reach adulthood. </p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>1846</li>
            <p>
                In 1846, Lincoln was elected to the U.S. Congress. His career got off to a stormy start, as he was not a staunch supporter of the war with <strong>Mexico</strong> , and he believed that slavery should be abolished. Both of these beliefs
                were not popular in his district of Illinois, and he was not re-elected.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>1855</li>
            <p>
                This bill so incensed Lincoln that he re-entered the political fray. However, Lincoln failed to receive the nomination for senator in 1855 and, convinced his former party, the Whigs, were essentially dead, he joined the new Republicans, becoming a prominent
                figure in the party.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>1860</li>
            <p>
                In 1860, Lincoln was elected presidential candidate for the Republican Party, although it was not an easy election. He was elected president but, as a result, seven Southern states seceded from the Union. In Lincoln's inauguration speech, he said that
                secession was anarchic and illegal. He told The Union that while he would not interfere with slavery, he would hold or repossess all Federal property. Civil war broke out soon after. It was a difficult time for Lincoln, but his tactics
                began to prevail. In his Gettysburg address, after a great victory for the North, Lincoln proclaimed that the end of the civil war stood for freedom and equality for all. However, the war dragged on, and critics began to question Lincoln's
                strategy and his chances for re-election. Following victory in the war, Lincoln was re-elected. In his second inaugural address, Lincoln urged the North and South to come together and bury past differences, "With malice toward none; and
                charity for all".</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>1865</li>
            <p>
                <cite>Lincoln never had an opportunity to govern outside war time as,</cite> on 14 April 1865, an assassin killed him. He was shot while watching the play <em>"Our American Cousins"</em> at the <address>Ford Theatre</address> by well-known
                actor and Confederate spy John Wilkes-Booth. Booth originally planned to kidnap the president but Lincoln made a speech on 11 April about voting rights for black people, angering Booth. After being in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died
                on 15 April. His body lay in state until 21 April and was taken on a tour of the north by train for three weeks, with thousands attending memorial services for him.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>2012</li>
            <p>
                In 2012, Steven Spielberg directed a biopic of the president's life called 'Lincoln'. Daniel Day-Lewis subsequently won a Best Actor Oscar® for his portrayal of the leader.</p>
